 you mount often. These filesystems
   can then be mounted with a shorter command, such as mount /cdrom.
   You can also configure filesystems to mount automatically when the
   system boots. You’ll probably want to mount all of your hard disk
   filesystems when you boot, so Debian automatically adds entries to
   fstab to do this for you.

   Look at this file now by typing more /etc/fstab. It will have two or
   more entries that were configured automatically when you installed
   the system. It probably looks something like this:

   # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
   # /
   # /   #
   # /   #
   # <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> #<dump > <pass>
   # 
   /dev/hda1 / ext2 defaults 0 1
   /
   /dev/hda3 none swap sw 0 0
   /
   proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
   /dev/hda5 /tmp ext2 defaults 0 2
   /
   /dev/hda6 /home ext2 defaults 0 2
   /
   /dev/hda7 /usr ext2 defaults 0 2
   /
   /dev/hdc /cdrom iso9660 ro,noauto 0 0
   /
   /dev/fd0 /floppy auto noauto,sync 0 0
   /
   /
   /
   /
   /
   The first column lists the device the filesystem resides on. The
   second lists the mount point, the third indicates the filesystem
   type. The line beginning by proc is a special filesystem. Notice
   that the swap partition (/dev/hda3 in the example) has no mount
   point, so the mount point column contains none.

   The last three columns may require some explanation.

   The fifth column is used by the dump utility to decide when to back
   up the filesystem. In most cases, you can put 0 here.

   The sixth column is used by fsck to decide in what order to check
   filesystems when you boot the system. The root filesystem should
   have a 1 in this field, filesystems that don’t need to be checked
   (such as the swap partition) should have a 0, and all other
   filesystems should have a 2. It’s worth noting that the swap
   partition isn’t exactly a filesystem in the sense that it does not
   contain files and directories but is just used by the Linux kernel
   as secondary memory. However, for historical reasons, the swap
   partitions are still listed in the same file as the filesystems.

   Column four contains one or more options to use when mounting the
   filesystem. You can check the mount manpage for a summary; see
   section 5.1 on page [*].


10.2.4 Removable Disks (Floppies, Zip Disks, Etc.)

   Add the following lines to your /etc/fstab file:

   /dev/sda1 /mnt/zip ext2 noauto,user 0 0
   /
   /dev/sda4 /mnt/dos msdos noauto,user 0 0
   /
   /
   /
   /
   From now on, you’ll be able to mount the DOS-formatted Zip disks
   with the command mount /mnt/dos, and you be able to mount
   Linux-formatted Zip disks with the command mount /mnt/zip.

   If you have SCSI hard disks in your system, you’ll have to change
   sda to sdb or sdc in the example above.


10.3 Backup Tools

   Backups are important under any operating system. Debian GNU/Linux
   provides several different utilities that you might want to use.
   Additionally, while many of these utilities were aimed at tape
   backups originally, you’ll find that they are now being used for
   other things. For instance, tar is being used for distributing
   programs over the Internet. Some of the utilities that you’ll find
   include the following:

     ◼ Taper is a menu-driven, easy-to-learn backup program that can
     back up to a variety of media. Its limitation is that it doesn’t
     handle large (4GB or larger) backups.
     ◼ dump is designed specifically for tapes; its main strengths are
     its interface for file restores, low-level filesystem backups, and
     incremental backup scheduling. Its limitations include the
     inability to back up NFS or other non-ext2 filesystems and some
     rather arcane defaults.
     ◼ GNU tar (short for Tape ARchiver) is an implementation of what
     is probably the most widely used backup or archiving utility in
     Linux today. It makes a good general purp
