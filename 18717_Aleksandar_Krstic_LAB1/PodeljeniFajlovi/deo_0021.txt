   work for each disk is outlined here:

    1. Insert the CD in your CD-ROM drive.
    2. From the main dselect menu, select “Install.”
    3. Wait until dpkg finishes installing from this CD. (It may report
    installation successful, or possibly installation errors. Don’t
    worry about these until later.)
    4. Press Return to go back to the main dselect menu.
    5. Repeat with the next CD in the set.

   It may be necessary to run the installation step more than once to
   cover the order of package installation; some packages installed
   early may need to have later packages installed before they will
   configure properly.

   Running a “Configure” step is recommended to help fix any packages
   that may end up in this state.

   multi_nfs, multi_mount. These are similar to the multi_cd method and
   are refinements on the theme of coping with changing media—for
   example, installing from a multi_cd set exported via NFS from
   another machine’s CD-ROM drive. indexdselect!multi-NFS, multi-mount
   installation

   apt. One of the best options for installation from a local mirror of
   the Debian archive or from the network. This method uses the “apt”
   system to do complete dependency analysis and ordering, so it’s most
   likely to install packages in the optimal order.

   Configuration of this method is straightforward. You may select any
   number of different locations, mixing and matching file: URLs (local
   disks or NFS mounted disks), http: URLs, or ftp: URLs. Note,
   however, that the HTTP and FTP options do not support local
   authenticating proxies.

   If you have proxy server for either HTTP or FTP (or both), make sure
   you set the http_proxy and ftp_proxy environment variables,
   respectively. Set them from your shell before starting dselect by
   using the following command:

   # export http_proxy=http://gateway:3128/
   # 
   # dselect
   # 
   # 
   # 
   # 
  Update

   dselect will read the Packages or Packages.gz files from the mirror
   and create a database on your system of all available packages. This
   may take a while as it downloads and processes the files.

  Select

   Hang on to your hat. This is where it all happens. The object of the
   exercise is to select just which packages you wish to have
   installed.

   Press Enter. If you have a slow machine, be aware that the screen
   will clear and can remain blank for 15 seconds. So don’t start
   bashing keys at this point.

   The first thing that comes up on the screen is page 1 of the Help
   file. You can get to this help by pressing ? at any point in the
   “Select” screens, and you can page through the help screens by
   hitting the . (full stop) key.

   Before you dive in, note these points:

     ◼ To exit the “Select” screen after all selections are complete,
     press Enter. This will return you to the main screen if there is
     no problem with your selection. Otherwise, you will be asked to
     deal with that problem. When you are happy with any given screen,
     press Enter to get out.
     ◼ Problems are quite normal and are to be expected. If you select
     package A and that package requires package B to run, dselect will
     warn you of the problem and will most likely suggest a solution.
     If package A conflicts with package B (i.e., if they are mutually
     exclusive), you will be asked to decide between them.

   Let’s look at the top two lines of the Select screen. This header
   reminds us of some of the special keys listed in Table 3.1.
