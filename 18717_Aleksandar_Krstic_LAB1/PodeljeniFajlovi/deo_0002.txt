Preface


_“Freedom is still the most radical idea of all.”_

   This quote, penned by Nathaniel Branden, seems fitting nowhere
   moreso than with the freewheeling computing industry. In the space
   of just a few decades, lives the world over have been changed by
   computing technology. We, the people behind the Free Software
   movement, are seeking to continue this trend by truly opening up
   software to everyone—not just the few people working for the
   companies that write it—but everyone. As part of this goal, this
   book and CD contain a treasure chest of Free Software. Over one
   thousand packages, including things such as the world’s most popular
   web server, can be found here. You can use this software for
   everything from graphic design to SQL databases.

   The Free Software revolution has taken the industry by storm. Linux,
   started from scratch not even 10 years ago, has been the favorite
   kernel of the Free Software world. The ideas and experience gained
   from Free Software have truly sent Linux and the Free Software
   Foundation’s GNU tools all over the world. Free systems such as
   Debian GNU/Linux ship with literally thousands of applications, and
   they have more power and stability, and outperform some of the
   industry’s traditional best-selling proprietary operating systems.

   Today, GNU/Linux plays a dominant role in Internet servers and among
   ISPs, in academia, among computer hobbyists, and in computer science
   research. Debian GNU/Linux has brought the power of Free Software to
   everything from laptops to flights aboard the Space Shuttle. As I
   write this, companies the world over are experiencing the joy and
