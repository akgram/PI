opposition is met at higher levels where profit-taking orders have been
placed. The very day when scale buying orders in a stock are withdrawn

business, in a general way, falls off as prices go up. The end of the
bear market is marked by the reappearance of “support” and the removal
of “pressure,” so that prices rebound quickly and sharply from declines.

The common assumption is that this “support” or “pressure” is supplied
by “manipulators.” But it is quite as likely to result from the scale
operations of hundreds of different persons, whose mental make-up
prevents them from buying or selling in the “impulsive” way.




VIII—The Mental Attitude of the Individual


In previous chapters we have seen that many, if not most, of
the eccentricities of speculative markets, commonly charged to
manipulation, are in fact due to the peculiar psychological conditions
which surround such markets. Especially, and more than all else
