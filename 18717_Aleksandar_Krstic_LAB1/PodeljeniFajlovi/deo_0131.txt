 great interests are
generally classified into three divisions—Morgan, Standard Oil, and

because each so-called interest consists of a loosely bound aggregation
of followers of all sorts and varieties, having only one thing in
common—control of capital. Such an “interest” is not an army, where
the traitor can be court-martialed and shot; it is a mob, and has to
be led, not driven. True, the known traitor might be put to death,
