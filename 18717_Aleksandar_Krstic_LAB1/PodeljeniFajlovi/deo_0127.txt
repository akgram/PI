formerly a professor of mathematics and wrote books on quaternions,
differential calculus, etc., once remarked that the study of
mathematics is very poor mental discipline, because it does not
cultivate the judgment. Given fixed and certain premises, your
mathematician will follow them out to a correct conclusion; but in
practical affairs the whole difficulty lies in selecting your premises.

So the market student of a mathematical turn of mind is always seeking
a rule or a set of rules—a “sure thing” as traders put it. He would not

In discussing the identity of Them, therefore, we must be content to
take obvious facts as we find them without attempting to spin fine
theories.

There are three senses in which this idea of “Them” has
