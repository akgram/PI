hand by the in-and-out class of traders. The market must decline until
a part of this floating supply is absorbed by the scale orders which
underlie current prices.

These conditions produce what is commonly called a “reaction.” Once
this surplus floating supply of stocks is absorbed by standing orders,
the market is ready to start upward again. If the general trend is
upward, far less resistance will be encountered on the advance than
was met on the reaction; hence prices rise to a new high level. Then
profit-taking sales will be met, on limited or scale orders at various
prices, and as the market advances the floating supply will gradually
increase until it again becomes unwieldy and another reaction is
necessary.

Eventually a level is reached, or some change in conditions appears,
which causes these scale buying orders to be partially or entirely
withdrawn, and selling orders to be substituted on a scale up. The bull
market will not go much further after this change takes place. It has
now become easier to produce declines than advances. The situation is
the reverse of that described above, and a bear market follows.

Commonly there is a considerable period around top prices when scale
buying orders are s
