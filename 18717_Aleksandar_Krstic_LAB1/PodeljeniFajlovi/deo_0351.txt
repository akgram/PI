first place, they overlook the very important point that between the
years of twenty and twenty-five a young man acquires rather than
achieves. It is the learning period of life, the experience-gaining
time. Knowledge that is worth anything does not come to us until we are

wise judgment. The great art of accurate decision in business matters
is not acquired in a few weeks of commercial life. It is the result of
years.
