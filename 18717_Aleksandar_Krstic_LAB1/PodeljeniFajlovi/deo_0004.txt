ktop operating systems such as DOS, Windows, and MacOS, GNU/Linux
   is usually found on large servers and _multiuser_ systems.

   This means that Debian has features those other operating systems
   lack. It allows a large number of people to use the same computer at
   once, as long as each user has his or her own _terminal_.[2] To
   permit many users to work at once, Debian must allow many programs
   and applications to run simultaneously. This feature is called
   _multitasking_.

 [2] A terminal is just a keyboard and a screen that are connected to
 the computer through the network, over a modem, or directly. You
 keyboard and monitor form a terminal that is directly attached to the
 computer: This special terminal is often called the _console_.

   Much of the power (and complexity) of GNU/Linux systems stems from
   these two features. For example, the system must have a way to keep
   users from accidentally deleting each other’s files. The operating
   system also must coordinate the many programs running at once to
   ensure that they don’t all use the same resource, such as a hard
   drive, at the same time.

   If you keep in mind what Debian was originally designed to do, many
   aspects of it will make a lot more sense. You’ll learn to take
   advantage of the power of these features.


1.3 What Is Free Software?

   When Debian developers and users speak of “Free Software,” they
   refer to _freedom_ rather than price. Debian is free in this sense:
   You are free to modify and redistribute it and will always have
   access to the source code for this purpose. The Debian Free Software
   Guidelines[3] describe in more detail exactly what is meant by
   “free.” The Free Software Foundation[4], originator of the GNU
   Project, is another excellent source of information. You can find a
   more detailed discussion of free software on the Debian web site[5].
   One of the most well-known works in this field is Richard M.
   Stallman’s essay, _Why Software Should Be Free_[6]; take a look at
   it for some insight into why we support Free Software as we do.
   Recently, some people have started calling Free Software “Open
   Source Software”; the two terms are interchangable.

   You may wonder why would people spend hours of their own time
   writing software and carefully packaging it, only to give it all
   away. The answers are as varied as the people who contribute.

   Many believe in sharing information and having the freedom to
   cooperate with one another, and they feel that free software
   encourages this. A long tradition that upholds these values,
   sometimes called the Hacker[7] Ethic, started in the 1950s. The
   Debian GNU/Linux Project was founded based on these Free Software
   ethics of freedom, sharing, and cooperation.

 [7] Note that the term “hacker” should not be confused with the term
 “cracker.” In short, a hacker is benevolent, whereas a cracker is
 generally considered malevolent. Movies and other forms of media many
 times incorrectly use the term “hacker” instead of “cracker.”

   Others want to learn more about computers. More and more people are
   looking for ways to avoid the inflated price of proprietary
   software. A growing community contributes in appreciation for all
   the great free software they’ve received from others.

   Many in academia create free software to help get the results of
   their research into wider use. Businesses help maintain free
   software so they can have a say in how it develops—there’s no
   quicker way to get a new feature than to implement it yourself or
   hire a consultant to do so! Business is also interested in greater
   reliability and the ability to choose between support vendors.

   Still others see free software as a social good, democratizing
   access to
