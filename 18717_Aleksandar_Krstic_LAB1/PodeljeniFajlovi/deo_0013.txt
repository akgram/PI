 of a floppy
   disk in _raw_ form. Disk images, such as resc1440.bin, cannot simply
   be copied to floppy drives. A special program is used to write the
   image files to floppy disk in _raw_ mode.

   First, you need to get to a DOS prompt. In Windows 95 and above, you
   can do this by double-clicking on an MS-DOS icon or by going to
   Start\( \rightarrow \)Programs\( \rightarrow \)MS-DOS prompt. Then,
   insert your Debian GNU/Linux CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. First,
   you change to your CD-ROM drive. In most cases, this is D:.

   C:\WINDOWS>D:

   Now, change to the directory containing the disk images.

   D:\>CD
   \DISTS\SLINK\MAIN\DISKS-I386\2.1.8-1999-02-22

   If you get an error, double-check what you’re typing. If the error
   persists, manually issue CD \DISTS\SLINK\MAIN\DISKS-I386, then run
   DIR, and then CD into the directory indicated. Note that the above
   commands, and some other examples below, may appear as a single line
   on your display even if they are wrapped here.

   Now, you’re ready to create the first of two disks. Start the
   program to write them out, rawrite2:

   D:\DISTS\SLINK\MAIN\DISKS-I386\
   2.1.8-1999-02-22>rawrite2
   RaWrite 2.0 - Write disk file to
   raw floppy diskette

   Rawrite2 starts and displays its welcome message. Next, it asks for
   the filename and diskette drive. You tell it to write resc1440.bin
   to a:

   Enter disk image source file name: resc1440.bin
   Enter target diskette drive: a:

   Rawrite2 now asks you to insert a disk into the floppy drive. Do so
   and press Enter.

   Plese insert a formatted diskette into
   drive A: and press -ENTER- :

   At this point, rawrite2 will create the first of the two disks. Now,
   you need to repeat the process for the second disk:

   D:\DISTS\SLINK\MAIN\DISKS-I386\
   2.1.8-1999-02-22>rawrite2
   RaWrite 2.0 - Write disk file to
   raw floppy diskette
   Enter disk image source file name: drv1440.bin
   Enter target diskette drive: a:
   Please insert a formatted diskette into
   drive A: and press -ENTER- :

   By now, your disks are created. You can now use the first one to
   boot.

  Booting Debian

   You are now ready to boot into Debian! Shut down your existing
   operating system, turn off your computer, and place the
   Install/Rescue Disk into the floppy drive. Now turn your computer
   back on. You should get a Welcome screen with a boot prompt at the
   bottom.


2.5 Booting the Installation System

   You should now have the boot prompt. Simply press Enter at this
   point.

   Once you press Enter, you should see the message Loading..., and
   then Uncompressing Linux..., and then a screenful or so of
   information about the hardware in your system. In general, you can
   ignore these messages. Linux will look for various hardware devices
   and will tell you what it finds and doesn’t find. Don’t worry about
   messages at this point. Just wait until you see the Color Selection
   screen. If you have trouble, see section B.2 on page [*].




3. Step-by-Step Installation


   dbootstrap is the name of the program that is run after you have
   booted into the installation system. It is responsible for initial
   system configuration and the installation of the “base system.”

   The main job of dbootstrap and the main purpose of your initial
   system configuration is to configure certain core elements of your
   system. For instance, this includes your IP address, host name, and
   other aspects of your networking setup, if any. This also includes
   the configuration of “kernel modules,” which are drivers that are
   loaded into the kernel. These modules include storage hardware
   drivers, network drivers, special language support, and support for
   other peripherals. Configuring these fundamental things is done
   first, because it is often necessary for the system to function
   properly for the next steps of installation.

   dbootstrap is a simple,
