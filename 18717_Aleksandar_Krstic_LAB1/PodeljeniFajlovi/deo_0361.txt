in a business
calling.

It is strange how reluctant young men are to accept, as the most vital
truth in life, that the most absolute honesty is the only kind of
honesty that succeeds in business. It isn't a question of religion or
religious beliefs. Honesty does not depend upon any religious creed or
dogma that was ever conceived. It is a question of a young man's own
conscience. He knows what is right and what is wrong. And yet, simple
as the matter is, it is astonishing how difficult it is of
understanding. An honest course in business seems too slow to the
average young man.
