now called
   mysamplefile.gz . It’s also a good bit smaller.

   $ gunzip mysamplefile.gz; ls -l

   This uncompresses the file. Observe that mysamplefile has returned
   to its original state. Notice that to uncompress, one uses gunzip,
   not gzip.

   $ rm mysamplefile

   Use this command to remove the file, since it was just to practice
   with.


7.4 Finding Files

   There are two different facilities for finding files: find and
   locate. find searches the actual files in their present state.
   locate searches an index generated by the system every morning at
   6:42 a.m. (this is a cron job, explained elsewhere in this book).
   locate won’t find any files that were created after the index was
   generated. However, because locate searches an index, it’s much
   faster—like using the index of a book rather than looking through
   the whole thing.

   To compare the two ways of finding files, pretend you can’t remember
   where the X configuration file XF86Config resides.

   $ locate XF86Config

   This should be pretty fast. You’ll get a list of filenames that
   contain XF86Config, something like this:

   /etc/X11/XF86Config
   /
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config
   /
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg
   /
   /usr/X11R6/man/man5/XF86Config.5x.gz
   /
   /
   /
   /
   Now try the find command:

   $ find / -name XF86Config

   You will hear a lot of disk activity, and this will take a lot
   longer. Results will look something like this:

   /etc/X11/XF86Config
   /
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config
   /
   find: /var/spool/cron/atjobs: Permission denied
   find: /var/spool/cron/atspool: Permission denied
   find: /var/lib/xdm/authdir: Permission denied

   Notice that find found only files that were named _exactly_
   XF86Config, rather than any files containing that string of letters.
   Also, find actually tried to look in every directory on the
   system—including some where you didn’t have read permissions. That’s
   why you got the Permission denied messages.

   The syntax is different as well. With find, you had to specify what
   directory to search in, whereas locate automatically chose the root
   directory. And you had to specify a search by name using the -name
   option. You could also have searched for files using many other
   criteria, such as modification date or owner. To have find search
   for files whose names match XF86Config, you’d have to use a
   wildcard:

   $ find / -name ’*XF86Config*’

   Like most of the command line tools, find accepts wildcards as
   arguments.

   In general, find is a more powerful utility, and locate is faster
   for everyday quick searches. The full range of possible searches
   would take a long time to explain; for more details , type info
   find, which will bring up the very thorough info pages on find and
   locate.


7.5 Determining a File’s Contents

   Debian comes with a utility that can guess at the contents of a file
   for you. Although it is not 100% accurate, you can use the following
   command to explore your system:

   $ file /bin/cp

   You should see something like this:

   /bin/cp: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 386, version 1
   /
   /
   /
   /
   Skipping the technical parts, this is an executable file for Intel
   machines.

   $ file /etc/init.d/boot

   The preceding command gives this response:

   /etc/init.d/boot: Bourne shell script text
   /
   /
   /
   /
   meaning that this is a text file containing a Bourne shell script.


7.6 Using a File Manager

   Instead of moving files around by hand, you can use a _file
   manager_. If you move a lot of files around, a file manager can make
   your work more efficient. There are text-based file managers, such
   as GNU Midnight Commander (mc), and a number of file managers for
   the X Window system (for example gmc for the X Window version of GNU
   Midnight Commander).

   Describing each of these is outside the scope
