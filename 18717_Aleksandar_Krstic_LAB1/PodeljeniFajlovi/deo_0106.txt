 substantial similarity, on every stock exchange and in every
speculative market of the world—and presumably will continue to do so
as long as prices are fixed by the competition of buyers and sellers,
and as long as human beings seek a profit and fear a loss.[1]

Beginning with a condition of dullness and inactivity, with small
fluctuations and very slight public interest, prices begin to rise, at
first almost imperceptibly. No special reason appears for the advance,
and it is generally thought to be merely temporary, due to small
professional operations. There is, of course, some short interest in
the market, mostly, at this time, of the character sometimes called
a “sleeping” short interest. An active speculative stock is never
entirely free from shorts.

As there is so little public speculation at this period in the cycle,
there are but few who are willing to sell out on so small an advance,
hence prices are not met by any large volume of profit-taking. The
smaller professionals take the short side for a turn, with the idea
that trifling fluctuations are the best that can be hoped for at the
moment and must be taken advantage of if any profits are to be secured.
This class of selling brings prices back almost to their former dead
level.
