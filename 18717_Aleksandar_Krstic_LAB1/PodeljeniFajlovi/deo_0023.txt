   EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
   __ Opt admin    boot-floppie Scripts to create the Debian
   __ Opt devel    newt0.25-dev Developer’s toolkit for newt
   __ Opt devel    slang1-dev   The S-Lang programming library
   __ Opt devel    slang1-pic   The S-Lang programming library

   If you decide now that you don’t want boot-floppies, just press
   Enter.

   Pressing the D key puts things the way I selected them in the first
   place:

   EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
   _* Opt admin    boot-floppie Scripts to create the Debian

   __ Opt devel    newt0.25-dev Developer’s toolkit for newt
   __ Opt devel    slang1-dev   The S-Lang programming library
   __ Opt devel    slang1-pic   The S-Lang programming library

   Pressing the U key restores dselect’s selections:

           EIOM Pri Section  Package      Description
   _* Opt admin    boot-floppie Scripts to create the Debian
   installation
   _* Opt devel    newt0.25-dev Developer’s toolkit for newt
   _* Opt devel    slang1-dev   The S-Lang programming library
   _* Opt devel    slang1-pic   The S-Lang programming library

   I suggest running with the defaults for now; you will have ample
   opportunities to add more later.

   Whatever you decide, press Enter to accept and return to the main
   screen. If this results in unresolved problems, you will be bounced
   right back to another problem resolution screen.

   The R, U, and D keys are very useful in “what if” situations. You
   can experiment at will and then restore everything and start again.
   _Don’t_ look on them as being in a glass box labeled “Break in Case
   of Emergency.”

   After making your selections in the Select screen, press I to give
   you a big window, press t to take you to the beginning, and then use
   the Page Down key to look quickly through the settings. This way you
   can check the results of your work and spot glaring errors. Some
   people have deselected whole groups of packages by mistake and not
   noticed the error until too late. dselect is a _very_ powerful tool;
   don’t misuse it.

   You should now have the situation shown in Table 3.3.

   Happy? Press Enter to exit the Select process. You can come back and
   run Select again if you wish.

  Install

   dselect runs through the entire set of packages and installs those
   selected. Expect to be asked to make decisions as you go. It is
   often useful to switch to a different shell to compare, say, an old
   configuration with a new one. If the old file is conf.modules, the
   new one will be conf.modules.dpkg-dist.

   The screen scrolls past fairly quickly on a fast machine. You can
   stop and start it with Ctrl-s and Ctrl-q, respectively, and at the
   end of the run, you will get a list of any uninstalled packages.

   It can happen that a package does not get installed because it
   depends on some other package that is listed for installation but is
   not yet installed. The answer here is to run Install again. Cases
   have been reported where it was necessary to run it four times
   before everything slipped into place. This will var
