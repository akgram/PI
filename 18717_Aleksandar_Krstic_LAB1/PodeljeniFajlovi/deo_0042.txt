   /usr contains most of the files you’ll be interested in. It
           /has
           many subdirectories. /usr/bin and /usr/sbin are pretty much
           like
           /bin and /sbin, except that the directories in /usr are not
           considered “essential to the operation of the system.”

           While not essential to getting the computer working, /usr
           does contain the applications you’ll use to get real work
           done. Also in
           /usr, you’ll find the /usr/man, /usr/info, and /usr/doc
           directories. These contain manual pages, info pages, and
           other documentation, respectively. And don’t forget
           /usr/games!

   /usr/local
           The Debian system doesn’t install anything in this
           directory. You should use it if you want to install software
           that you compile yourself or any software not contained in a
           Debian package. You can also install software in your home
           directory if you’ll be the only one using it.

   /etc
           /etc contains all the system-wide configuration files.
           /Whenever
           you want to change something that affects all users of your
           computer—such as how you connect to the Internet or what
           kind of video card you have—you’ll probably have to log on
           as root and change a file in /etc.

   /tmp
           Here you’ll find temporary files, most of them created by
           the system. This directory is generally erased on a regular
           basis or every time you reboot the system. You can create
           files here if you want, just be aware that they might get
           deleted automatically.

   /var
           /var contains “variable” files that the system changes
           automatically. For example, incoming mail is stored here.
           The system keeps a log of its actions here. There are a
           number of other automatically generated files here as well.
           You’ll mostly be interested in the contents of /var/log,
           where you can find error messages that can help you figure
           out what you’re system’s up to if something goes wrong.

   Clearly there are many more directories on the system—far too many
   to describe every one.

   For changing things, you’ll usually want to confine yourself to your
   home directory and /etc. On a Debian system, there’s rarely an
   occasion to change anything else, because everything else is
   automatically installed for you.

   /etc is used to configure the _system_ as a whole. You’ll use your
   /own home
   directory, a subdirectory of /home, for configuring your own
   preferences and storing your personal data. The idea is that on a
   day-to-day basis, you confine yourself to /home/_yourname_, so
   there’s no way you can break anything. Occasionally you log in as
   root to change something in a system-wide directory, but only when
   it’s absolutely necessary. Of course, if you’re using Debian at a
   school or business and someone else is the system administrator, you
   won’t have root access and will be able to change only your home
   directory and any other directory that you own. This limits what you
   can do with the system.


7.3 File Compression with gzip

   Often it would be nice to make a file smaller—say, to download it
   faster, or so it takes up less space on your disk. The program to do
   this is called gzip (GNU zip). Here’s how it works:

   $ cd; cp /etc/profile ./mysamplefile

   This switches to your home directory and copies an arbitrarily
   chosen file (/etc/profile) to your current directory, in the process
   renaming it mysamplefile. This gives you a file to play with when
   using gzip.

   $ ls -l

   Lists the contents of the current directory. Note the size of
   mysamplefile.

   $ gzip mysamplefile

   Compresses mysamplefile.

   $ ls -l

   Observe the results of this command: mysamplefile is
