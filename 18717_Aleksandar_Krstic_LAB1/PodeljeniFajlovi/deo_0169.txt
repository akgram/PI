sagging market for high-grade bonds.




VII—The Psychology of Scale Orders


The observer of market conditions soon comes to know that there are
two general classes of minds whose operations are reflected in prices.
These classes might be named the “impulsive” and the “phlegmatic.”

The “impulsive” operator says, for example, “Conditions, both
