). To access a filesystem, you must mount it at some mount
   point.

   So, for example, you might mount a CD at the mount point /cdrom.
   This means that if you look in the directory /cdrom, you’ll see the
   contents of the CD. The /cdrom directory itself is actually on your
   hard disk. For all practical purposes, the contents of the CD become
   a part of the root filesystem, and when you type commands and use
   programs, it doesn’t make any difference what the actual physical
   location of the files is. You could have created a directory on your
   hard disk called /cdrom and put some files in it, and everything
   would behave in exactly the same way. Once you mount a filesystem,
   there’s no need to pay any attention to physical devices.

   However, before you can mount a filesystem or actually create a
   filesystem on a disk that doesn’t have one yet, it’s necessary to
   refer to the devices themselves. All devices have names, which are
   located in the /dev directory. If you type ls /dev now, you’ll see a
   pretty lengthy list of every possible device you could have on your
   Debian system. For a summary of some devices, see Table 2.1 on page
   [*]. A more thorough list can be found on your system in the file
   /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt.

   To mount a filesystem, we want to tell Linux to associate whatever
   filesystem it finds on a particular device with a particular mount
   point. In the process, we might have to tell Linux what kind of
   filesystem to look for.


10.2.2 Example: Mounting a CD-ROM

   As a simple demonstration, we’ll go through mounting a CD-ROM, such
   as the one you may have used to install Debian. You’ll need to be
   root to do this, so be careful; whenever you’re root, you have the
   power to manipulate the whole system, not just your own files. Also,
   these commands assume there’s a CD in your drive; you should put one
   in the drive now. Then start with the following command:

   su

   If you haven’t already, you need to either log in as root or gain
   root privileges with the su (super user) command. If you use su,
   enter the root password when prompted.

   ls /cdrom

   Use this command to see what’s in the /cdrom directory before you
   start. If you don’t have a /cdrom directory, you may have to make
   one using mkdir /cdrom.

   mount

   Simply typing mount with no arguments lists the currently mounted
   filesystems.

   mount -t iso9660 _CD-device_ /cdrom

   For this command, you should substitute the name of your CD-ROM
   device for _CD-device_ in the above command line. If you aren’t
   sure, /dev/cdrom is a good guess because the install process should
   have created this symbolic link on the system. If that fails, try
   the different IDE devices:
   /dev/hdc, etc. You should see a message like this: mount: block
   /device dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only.
   /
   /
   /
   The -t option specifies the type of the filesystem, in this case
   iso9660. Most CDs are iso9660. The next argument is the name of the
   device to mount, and the final argument is the mount point. There
   are many other arguments for mount; see the manual page for details.

   Once a CD is mounted, you may find that your drive tray will not
   open. You must unmount the CD before removing it.

   ls /cdrom

   Confirms that /cdrom now contains whatever is on the CD in your
   drive.

   mount

   Displays the list of filesystems again; notice that your CD drive is
   now mounted.

   umount /cdrom

   This unmounts the CD. It’s now safe to remove the CD from the drive.
   Notice that the command is umount with no “n,” even though it’s used
   to unmount the filesystem.

   exit

   Don’t leave yourself logged on as root. Log out immediately, just to
   be safe.


10.2.3 /etc/fstab: Automating the Mount Process

   The file /etc/fstab (it stands for “filesystem table”) contains
   descriptions of filesystems that
