PREFACE


This book is based upon the belief that the movements of prices on the
exchanges are dependent to a very large degree on the mental attitude
of the investing and trading public. It is the result of years of
study and experience as fellow at Columbia University, news writer,
statistician, on the editorial staff of THE MAGAZINE OF WALL STREET,
etc.

The book is intended chiefly as a practical help to that considerable
part of the community which is interested, directly or indirectly, in
the markets; but it is hoped that it may also have some scientific
value as a preliminary discussion in a new field, where opportunities
for further research seem almost unlimited.
