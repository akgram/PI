 are some suggestions:

     ◼ Use the man pages and the -help or -h option to get a quick
     summary of a command’s syntax and options. Also use man if a
     program doesn’t yet have an info page.
     ◼ Use info if a program has info documentation.
     ◼ If neither of those works, look in /usr/doc/_packagename_.
     ◼ /usr/doc/_packagename_ often has Debian-specific information,
     even if there’s a man page or info page.
     ◼ Use the HOWTOs for instructions on how to set up a particular
     thing or for information on your particular hardware. For example,
     the Ethernet HOWTO has a wealth of information on Ethernet cards,
     and the PPP HOWTO explains in detail how to set up PPP.
     ◼ Use the Debian Documentation Project manuals for conceptual
     explanations and Debian-specific information.
     ◼ If all else fails, ask someone. See section A.1.3 on page [*].
     Using man pages is discussed above in section 5.1 on page [*].
     It’s very simple: press the space bar to go to the next page, and
     press q to quit reading. Using info, viewing files in /usr/doc,
     and asking for help from a person are all discussed in the
     remainder of this chapter.


A.1.1 Using info

   info is the GNU documentation viewer. Some programs provide
   documentationin info format, and you can use info to view that
   documentation. You can start up the viewer by simply typing info, or
   by supplying a topic as well:

   info emacs

   You can also bring up the information on info itself, which includes
   a tutorial, like so:

   info info

   Now, you may navigate with these keys:

   arrows

   Move the cursor around the document

   m RET

   Select the menu item that’s at the cursor

   u

   Move “up” in the document

   n

   Move to the next page

   p

   Move to the previous page

   s

   Search for something

   g

   Go to a specific page

   q

   Quit info

   You might notice that the top line of the screen indicates the next,
   previous, and “up” pages, corresponding nicely to the actions for
   the n, p, and u keys.


A.1.2 HOWTOs

   In addition to their books, the Linux Documentation Project has made
   a series of short documents describing how to set up particular
   aspects of GNU/Linux. For instance, the SCSI-HOWTO describes some of
   the complications of using SCSI—a standard way of talking to
   devices—with GNU/Linux. In general, the HOWTOs have more specific
   information about particular hardware configurations and will be
   more up to date than this manual.

   There are Debian packages for the HOWTOs. doc-linux-text contains
   the various HOWTOs in text form; the doc-linux-html package contains
   the HOWTOs in (surprise!) browsable HTML format. Note also that
   Debian has packaged translations of the HOWTOs in various languages
   that you may prefer if English is not your native language. Debian
   has packages for the German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese,
   Korean, Polish, Swedish and Chinese versions of the HOWTOs. These
   are usually available in the package doc-linux-_languagecode_, where
   _languagecode_ is fr for French, es for Spanish, etc. If you’ve
   installed one of these, you should have them in
   /usr/doc/HOWTO. However, you may be able to find more recent
   /versions on
   the Net at the LDP homepage[4].

A.1.3 Personal Help

   The correct place to ask for help with Debian is the debian-user
   mailing list at debian-user@lists.debian.org. If you know how to use
   IRC (Internet Relay Chat), you can use the #debian channel on
   irc.debian.org. You can find general GNU/Linux help on the
   comp.os.linux.* USENET hierarchy. It is also possible to hire paid
   consultants to provide guaranteed support services. The Debian
   website[5] has more information on many of these resources.
